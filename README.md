  ## Installation

  Clone the repo from GitHub on to your machine. Then simply run the command `npm install` to download all of the dependencies. Now you are all set to run the api!

  ## Usage

  Use the command `npm start` to start the server. Since there is no front end currently you will need to use an API client like Insomnia to see the API routes in action. Below is a video walk through of the application.
